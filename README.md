# What is it?

You can find out more about HAML at http://haml-lang.com  
You can find out more about GO at http://golang.org

Ruby-based parser, so if you feel familiar with the one, then you should feel
familiar with the other.

This branch compiles with 6g/8g "go version go1.1.1."

# Is it done?

just me.

# How can I install this from source?

You really can't, just yet. Wait until I work that out...

# How can I use it?

You really can't, just yet. Wait until I work that out...
